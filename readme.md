### This app works within the angular MVC framework
*model- data*
*controller- glue of the application. middle man/ operator that does al lthe logic for the application

view- the DOM- 

for example in the previous movieapp git... if the ratings change on superman vs batman. the data would have changed in the model. while the dom would still be unaware
the model will then contact the controller. the controller will then make the decision of weather the data will be update

*example if you have a form

-angular makes the process of mvc much easier mvc is a way of organizing data

-angular has a declaritive interface

    -you tell the computer what to do and you tell the computer what to do
    
    
takes everything from html files and puts it into script file

-very short unobtrusive statements

Data Models are POJO-POJO means Plain old javascript object format
dont have to deal wtih sql or oracle 

angular already treats everything like a javascript object


define your own directive
ex <accordion></accordion> assign what you want accordion to do in side divider 


/keep dom manipulation using data binding stuff
/keeps you from having to manually manipulate dom using jquery

unit testing ready

very easy to add unit test 

angular app takes pressure away from the do
